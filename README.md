# Neural Style Transfer with VGG-19

This project demonstrates the implementation of neural style transfer using a pre-trained VGG-19 model. The goal is to blend the content of one image with the style of another to create a new, visually appealing image.

## Introduction
Neural style transfer is a technique used to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another. This project uses the VGG-19 model to achieve this by optimizing the content and style representations of the images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Pillow
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   !pip install torch torchvision Pillow matplotlib
2. Upload your content and style images. Make sure they are named appropriately (e.g., content_image.jpg and style_image.jpg).
3. Run the provided Colab notebook code.


Detailed Working
The project involves several key steps:

1. Image Preprocessing: Loading and transforming the images for the VGG-19 model.
2. Model Setup: Loading the pre-trained VGG-19 model and setting up the necessary layers for content and style loss.
3. Loss Functions: Defining content and style loss functions to measure the difference between the target and generated images.
4. Optimization: Using an optimizer to minimize the loss and generate the final styled image.
